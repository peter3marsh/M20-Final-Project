function [indicator] = CheckColonyProximity(x, y, colony_pos, colony_proximity_threshold)
%{
CheckColonyProximity returns true/false for whether the colony is close 
enough for an ant to put down the food.

outputs:
    indicator: true (logical 1) if the ant is close the colony, and 
               false (logical 0) if it's not.

inputs:
    x: the x coordinate of the ant
    y: the y coordinate of the ant
    colony_pos: The (x, y) of the colony center (a 1-by-2 
        array)
    colony_proximity_threshold: The range to determine whether an ant is
        close to colony enough to put down the food
%}

% Compute the distance from the ant to the colony
distance = sqrt(( x - colony_pos(1) )^2 + ( y - colony_pos(2) )^2);
distance = min(distance);

% If the distance is within the proximity threshold
%   Return true (logical 1) for the indicator
if distance <= colony_proximity_threshold
    indicator = 1;
    return
% Else
%   Return false (logical 0) for the indicator
else
    indicator = 0;
    return
